SmartScheduler Presentation Demo Script

TERMINAL 1 (Project Setup & Monitor)

1. Cleanup and Build (Optional but recommended for clean slate)

cd ~/Projects/SmartScheduler
make clean
./scripts/build.sh

(Explain: Compiling kernel module and user-space tools from scratch)


2. Load Kernel Module (CRITICAL STEP)

sudo rmmod smartscheduler 2>/dev/null
sudo insmod kernel/smartscheduler.ko

cat /proc/smartscheduler/status

(Explain: Module is now active and sampling processes every 100ms)


3. Start Monitor (The New Python TUI)

sudo python3 user/smartmonitor.py --interval 500

(Show: System Overview header, Power State, Advisory panel)
(Keep this terminal running and visible for the audience)



TERMINAL 2 (Workload Generator)

4. Demonstrate Safe App Protection

cd ~/Projects/SmartScheduler

# Generate high CPU load using Python
python3 -c "while True: pass" &

(Show in TERMINAL 1: 
 - Process 'python3' appears with ~100% CPU.
 - Status is SAFE (Green). 
 - Explain: Python is whitelisted as a safe app, so it is never killed.)

Cleanup:
killall python3


5. Demonstrate Blocklist Kill (Red Pulse Animation)

# Create a fake "cryptominer" process using a system utility
cp /bin/yes ./cryptominer

# Run it (generates 100% CPU)
./cryptominer > /dev/null &

(Show in TERMINAL 1: 
 - Process 'cryptominer' appears with >95% CPU.
 - Matches blocklist entry.
 - Row turns RED and pulses for 2 seconds.
 - KILLED automatically.
 - Advisory panel logs the kill action.)

(Explain: The monitor detected a blocklisted process exceeding the threshold and terminated it to save resources.)


6. Verify Process is Gone

pgrep -a cryptominer
(Should return nothing)



TERMINAL 1 (Backup Demo Mode)

7. If kernel module fails to load (Contingency):

python3 user/smartmonitor.py --demo

(Explain: Simulation mode with synthetic data for checking UI layout)
